## Description

Employee Tracker is an application that allows you to manage a master roster of all the employees at your company. This application uses node, inquirer, and MySQL. The user has the ability to add departments, roles, and new employees, as well as update existing employees if they get promoted! The purpose of this assignment was to apply what we learned about structured databases and relational databases. I now have a much better grasp on what structured data looks like and how to manipulate it in a way that is relevant.

## Installation

Pull the project down from the GitHub repository, npm install the necessary dependencies, and run node rosterCode in your command line.

## Usage

After runnning node rosterCode in your command line, you will receive a series of prompts asking what you would like to do with your company data. Follow the prompts to view and add departments, roles, and employees, as well as update employees.

## Tests

There are no tests for this application.
